```shell
yo
```

This will open a [REPL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop) interface, with 2 types of prompts

- `ðŸš€ exec`: will generate a command line to execute for what you're asking
- `ðŸ’¬ chat`: will engage in a discussion to help you the best way possible

You also can use the following `keyboard shortcuts`:

| Keys     | Description                                         |
|----------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| `â†‘` `â†“`  | Navigate in history                                 |
| `tab`    | Switch between `ðŸš€ exec` and `ðŸ’¬ chat` prompt modes |
| `ctrl+h` | Show help                                           |
| `ctrl+s` | Edit settings                                       |
| `ctrl+r` | Clear terminal and reset discussion history         |
| `ctrl+l` | Clear terminal but keep discussion history          |
| `ctrl+c` | Exit or interrupt command execution                 |
