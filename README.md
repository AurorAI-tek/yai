## Description

`Yo` is an AI powered assistant for your terminal.

You can converse in your natural language, and it will provide you with either pre-built command lines or engage in discussion to assist you.

To be the most accurate possible, it is already aware of your:
- operating system
- distribution
- username
- shell
- home directory
- preferred editor

You can also give any preferences to fine tune your user experience (see [configuration](#configuration) section).

## Installation

```shell
go get && sudo go build -o /usr/local/bin/yo && sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/yo
```

## Configuration

At the first execution, your assistant will ask you to provide an [OpenAI API key](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys).

It will then generate your configuration in the file `~/.config/yo.json`, and will have the following structure:

```JS
{
  "openai_key": "sk-xxxxxxxxx",  // your OpenAI API key
  "openai_proxy": "",            // proxy to connect to OpenAI API if needed
  "openai_temperature": 0.2,     // chatGPT temperature
  "user_default_mode": "exec",   // prefered run mode: "exec" (default) or "chat"
  "user_preferences": ""         // to express preferences in natural language
}
```

## Usage

`Yo` provides 2 modes:
- REPL: terminal user interface, made to offer interactive prompts in a loop
- CLI: command line interface, made to perform a single execution

### REPL mode

```shell
yo
```

This will open a [REPL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop), with 2 types of prompts

- `ðŸš€ exec`: will try to provide a command line for what you're asking
- `ðŸ’¬ chat`: will engage discussion to help you the best way possible

You also can use the following shortcuts:

| Keys     | Description                                    |
|----------|------------------------------------------------|
| `â†‘` `â†“`  | Navigate in history                            |
| `tab`    | Switch between `ðŸš€ exec` and `ðŸ’¬ chat` prompts |
| `ctrl+s` | Edit settings                                  |
| `ctrl+r` | Clear terminal and reset discussion history    |
| `ctrl+l` | Clear terminal but keep discussion history     |
| `ctrl+c` | Exit or interrupt current command / completion |


### CLI mode (*Coming soon*)

```shell
yo list all my files in my home directory
```

This will perform a single execution, according to your input.
